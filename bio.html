				I spent the first 18 years of my life in Mumbai and attended an International High School before I left for pursuing higher studies at the University of Toronto. High school was academically challenging for me and I couldnt seem to do even close to as well as my peers in most subjects. I was an average student because I never actually got around to studying even though I would sit in front of my textbook for hours and convince myself that I was making progress. I wasn't interested in most subjects in high school but excelled in physics, chemistry and mathematics. I took a spontaneous decision to learn Java programming over the summer of 10th grade but I was always "techie" keeping up with the most recent developments in the field. At first I was intimidated by the concept of programming but as I dipped deeper into the topic I realized that logical reasoning and problem solving were the two most important components to it. I started looking at it like a more complex version of the mathematical puzzles my mother used to buy me as a child and the art instantly grew on me. I felt comfortable with the concepts and interested in finding the most efficient way to solve a problem, and the best way to prove that its the most efficient. I soon started self studying alot, building my own apps, watching youtube videos - basic "its just a phase" stuff. I myself expected to give it up eventually and move on to something else, which I did with most things growing up. For some odd reason, this was different, this stuck. I continued to learn more about it because the information was infinite. Consistently growing, new technologies such as cloud computing, virtual reality and new possibilities kept arising. The idea that kept me going the most was how much this would impact the everyday life of a human. The advent of the smartphones kicked in and the rapid dependency people (including me) created on it was truly mindblowing. It was a paradigm shift in lifestyle and I knew in this field there were so many more to come. By the time College applications came into play I was pretty certain as to what I wanted to do with my life. Coming to university and taking up Computer Science, I realized that doing school work for hours and hours wasnt even an issue for me anymore. I could sit for hours and not realize the time go by while fixated on a simple or complex bug in my code. The satisfaction of the working project was always worth it all in the end. Ive been into this field for 5 years now and I'm almost a 100% sure its not a phase anymore. I also learned that phasing in and out of things was the best thing I could have done for myself, even though most people considered me as being "inconsistent", it helped me eliminate everything I thought I wanted to do and helped me find the right path for me.
