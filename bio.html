				Hi! I'm Jeevika Ghosh and I am currently in Dhirubhai Ambani International School and I'm studying in grade 12. Here are 5 things about me that you should know:

				<br>1) I am a tinker in my home—forever fascinated by the way machines work and fixated on fixing things, even if some are already fixed.  Unfortunately for my mother, instead of solving crosswords and puzzles like a normal person, I love rewiring the television and dissecting remote controls.

<br>2) I am a cleverly disguised adult—a 10 year old soul trapped in the body of a 18 year old girl. To procrastinate, I resort to animated Disney films (Up is currently my favourite), and I seek solace in fuzzy bunny slippers.

<br>3) I don't have a favorite for too long, my ‘most favorite’ changes twice or thrice a year. Though this is not applicable to cheese, chocolates and mangoes.

<br>4) I am brave enough to go skydiving and enrol in all the possible types of adventure sports, but I am still afraid of the dark.

<br>5) I am passionate about tech, kathak (a cultural indian dance) and travelling around the world, but the things that inspire me the most are love and friendship.
